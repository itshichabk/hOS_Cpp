# hOS_Cpp
A second attempt at making an "operating system" that runs on a console app. Now in C++ and with PDCurses!

hOS is a console app project that I first started in December 2021 when I was learning C at a cheap vocational training school, with a basic login system, a programs menu and some unfinished programs like a calculator.

Now that I'm learning C++ in college, I thought it would be great to reset the project and make a fresh start. From now on, not only will it be object-oriented unlike in  C, but the PDCurses library will also be used for more advanced text-mode functions like changing colors and making windows!
